Sample project showcasing various JS testing frameworks
=======================================================

* Add any necessary vendor scripts to `vendor/` and update `Gruntfile.js`
* Update `Gruntfile.js` grunt file w/ test framework plugin and config if/as necessary
* "Enhance" the sample app in `src/`
* Add some tests
* Write something in `deck/boilerplate.html` about your test framework of choice

One concern we discussed was view rendering/dom manipulation with fixtures, so it would be nice to see how this is tested in each framework.
